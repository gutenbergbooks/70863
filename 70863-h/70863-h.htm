<p class="nind">
<span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY theories have been proposed with a
view of accounting for the phænomenon of the aberration of light
according to the undulatory theory. In the first instance Fresnel, and
more recently Doppler, Stokes, Challis, and several others have
published important researches on this subject; though none of the
theories hitherto proposed appear to have received the complete approval
of physicists. Of the several hypotheses which have been necessitated by
the absence of any definite idea of the properties of luminiferous
æther, and of its relations to ponderable matter, not one can be
considered as established; they merely possess different degrees of
probability.
</p>
<p>
On the whole these hypotheses may be reduced to the following three,
having reference to the state in which the æther ought to be considered
as existing in the interior of a transparent body. Either, <i>first</i>,
the æther adheres or is fixed to the molecules of the body, and
consequently shares all the motions of the body; or <i>secondly</i>, the
æther is free and independent, and consequently is not carried with the
body in its movements; or, <i>thirdly</i>, only a portion of the æther
is free, the rest being fixed to the molecules of the body and, alone,
sharing its movements.
</p>
<p>
The last hypothesis was proposed by Fresnel, in order at once to satisfy
the conditions of the aberration of light and of a celebrated experiment
of Arago's, which proved that the motion of the earth does not affect
the value of the refraction suffered by the light of a star on passing
through a prism. Although these two phænomena may be explained with
admirable precision by means of this hypothesis, still it is far from
being considered at present as an established truth, and the relations
between æther and matter are still considered, by most, as unknown. The
mechanical conception of Fresnel has been regarded by some as too
extraordinary to be admitted without direct proofs; others consider that
the observed phænomena may also be satisfied by one of the other
hypotheses; and others, again, hold that certain consequences of the
hypothesis in question are at variance with experiment.
</p>
<p>
The following considerations led me to attempt an experiment the result
of which promised, I thought, to throw light on the question.
</p>
<p>
It will be observed that, according to the first hypothesis, the
velocity with which light traverses a body must vary with the motion of
that body. If the motions of the body and the ray are like-directed, the
velocity of light ought to be increased by the whole velocity of the
body.
</p>
<p>
If the æther be perfectly free, the velocity of light ought not to be
altered by the motion of the body.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, if the body when moving only carries with it a portion of the
æther, then the velocity of light ought to be increased by a fractional
part of the velocity of the body and not by the whole velocity, as in
the first case. This consequence is not as evident as the two preceding
ones, though Fresnel has shown that it is supported by mechanical
considerations of a very probable nature.
</p>
<p>
The question then resolves itself to that of determining with accuracy
the effect of the motion of a body upon the velocity with which light
traverses it.
</p>
<p>
It is true that the velocity with which light is propagated is so
immensely superior to any we are able to impart to a body, that any
change in the first velocity must in general be inappreciable.
Nevertheless, by combining the most favourable circumstances, it
appeared to be possible to submit to a decisive test at least two media,
air and water, to which, on account of the mobility of their particles,
a great velocity may be imparted.
</p>
<p>
We owe to Arago a method of observation, founded on the phænomena of
interference, which is well suited to render evident the smallest
variation in the index of refraction of a body, and hence also the least
change in the velocity with which the body is traversed by light; for,
as is well known, this velocity is inversely proportional to the
refracting index. Arago and Fresnel have both shown the extraordinary
sensitiveness of this method by several very delicate observations, such
as that on the difference of refraction between dry and moist air.
</p>
<p>
A method of observation founded upon this principle appeared to me to be
the only one capable of rendering evident any change of velocity due to
motion. It consists in obtaining interference bands by means of two rays
of light after their passage through two parallel tubes, through which
air or water can be made to flow with great velocity in opposite
directions. The especial object before me necessitated several new
arrangements, which I proceed to indicate.
</p>
<p>
With respect to the intensity of light, formidable difficulties had
necessarily to be encountered. The tubes, which were of glass and
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 10.446ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="5.3\, \text{millims}">. in diameter, had to be traversed by light
along their centres, and not near their sides; the two slits, therefore,
had to be placed much further apart than is ordinarily the case, on
which account the light would, in the absence of a special contrivance,
have been very feeble at the point where the interference bands are
produced.
</p>
<p>
This inconvenience was made to disappear by placing a convergent lens
behind the two slits; the bands were then observed at the point of
concourse of the two rays, where the intensity of light was very
considerable.
</p>
<p>
The length of the tubes being tolerably great, <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 11.192ex; height: 1.581ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.487\, \text{metre}">,
it was to be feared that some difference of temperature or pressure
between the two tubes might give rise to a considerable displacement of
the bands, and thus completely mask the displacement due to motion.
</p>
<p>
This difficulty was avoided by causing the two rays to return towards
the tubes by means of a telescope carrying a mirror at its focus. In
this manner each ray is obliged to traverse the two tubes successively,
so that the two rays having travelled over exactly the same path, but in
opposite directions, any effect due to difference of pressure or
temperature must necessarily be eliminated by compensation. By means of
various tests I assured myself that this compensation was complete, and
that whatever change in the temperature or density of the medium might
be produced in a single tube, the bands would preserve exactly the same
position. According to this arrangement, the bands had to be observed at
the point of departure itself of the rays: solar light was admitted
laterally, and was directed towards the tubes by means of reflexion from
a transparent mirror; after their double journey through the tubes, the
rays returned and traversed the mirror before reaching the place of
interference, where the bands were observed by means of a graduated
eye-piece.
</p>
<p>
The double journey performed by the rays had also the advantage of
increasing the probable effect of motion; for this effect must be the
same as if the tubes had double the length and were only traversed once.
</p>
<p>
This arrangement also permitted the employment of a very simple method
for rendering the bands broader than they would otherwise have been in
consequence of the great distance (<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 8.686ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="9\, \text{millims}">.) between the
slits. This method consisted in placing a very thick plate of glass
before one of the slits, and inclining the same in such a manner that,
by the effect of refraction, the two slits had the appearance of being
very close to each other: in this manner the bands become as broad as
they would be if the two slits were, in reality, as near each other as
they appear to be; and instead of the intensity of light being sensibly
diminished by this expedient, it may, in fact, be greatly augmented by
giving greater breadth to the source of light. By causing the
inclination of the glass to vary, the breadth of the bands may be varied
at pleasure, and thus the magnitude most convenient for precisely
observing their displacement may be readily given to them.
</p>
<p>
I proceed to describe the disposition of the tubes, and the apparatus
destined to put the water in motion.
</p>
<p>
The two tubes, placed side by side, were closed at each extremity by a
single glass plate, fixed with gum-lac in a position exactly
perpendicular to their common direction. Near each extremity was a
branch tube, forming a rounded elbow, which established a communication
with a broader tube reaching to the bottom of a flask; there were thus
four flasks communicating with the four extremities of the tubes.
</p>
<p>
Into one flask, which we will suppose to be full of water, compressed
air, borrowed from a reservoir furnished with an air-pump, was
introduced through a communicating tube. Under the influence of this
pressure the water rose from the flask into the tube, which it then
traversed in order to enter the flask at the opposite end. The latter
could also receive compressed air, and then the liquid returned into the
first flask after traversing the tube in an opposite direction. In this
manner a current of water was obtained whose velocity exceeded
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 18.889ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="7\, \text{metres per second}">. A similar current, but in an opposite
direction, was produced at the same time in the other tube.

</p>
<p>
Within the observer's reach were two cocks fixed to the reservoir of
air; on opening either, currents, opposite in direction, were
established in both tubes; on opening the other cock the currents in
each tube were simultaneously reversed.
</p>
<p>
The capacity of the reservoir, containing air at a pressure of about two
atmospheres, amounted to <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 7.561ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="15\, \text{litres}"> (half a cubic foot), that of each
flask to about <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 6.43ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2\, \text{litres}">; the latter were divided into equal
volumes, and the velocity of the water was deduced from the section of the
tubes, and from the time of efflux of half a litre.
</p>
<p>
The apparatus above described was only employed for the experiments with
water in motion: with some modifications it might also be used for air;
but my experiments on moving air had been previously made with a
slightly different apparatus, of which more hereafter, and the results
had been found quite conclusive. I had already proved that <i>the motion of
air produces no appreciable displacement of the bands</i>. But I shall
return to this result and give further details.
</p>
<p>
For water there is an evident displacement. <i>The bands are displaced
towards the right when the water recedes from the observer in the tube
at his right, and approaches him in the tube on his left</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>The displacement of the bands is towards the left when the direction of
the current in each tube is opposite to that just defined.</i>
</p>
<p>
During the motion of the water the bands remain well defined, and move
parallel to themselves, without the least disorder, through a space
apparently proportional to the velocity of the water. With a velocity of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 18.889ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2\, \text{metres per second}"> even, the displacement is perceptible; for
velocities between <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 13.595ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/8.svg" alt=" " data-tex="4\, \text{and}\, 7\, \text{metres}"> it is perfectly
measureable.
</p>
<p>
In one experiment, where a band occupied five divisions of the
micrometer, the displacement amounted to <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 11.781ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.2\, \text{divisions}">
towards the right and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 11.781ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.2\, \text{divisions}"> towards the left, the
velocity of the water being <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 21.781ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/10.svg" alt=" " data-tex="7.05\, \text{metres per second}">.
The sum of the two displacements, therefore, was equal to
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 11.781ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/11.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2.4\, \text{divisions}">, or nearly half the breadth of a band.
</p>
<p>
In anticipation of a probable objection, I ought to state that the
system of the two tubes and four flasks, in which the motion of the
water took place, was quite isolated from the other parts of the
apparatus: this precaution was taken in order to prevent the pressure
and shock of the water from producing any accidental flexion in parts of
the apparatus whose motion might influence the position of the bands. I
assured myself, however, that no such influence was exerted, by
intentionally imparting motions to the system of the two tubes.
</p>
<p>
After establishing the existence of the phænomenon of displacement, I
endeavoured to estimate its magnitude with all possible exactitude. To
avoid all possible sources of error, I varied the magnification of the
bands, the velocity of the water, and even the nature of the divisions
of the micrometer, so as to be unable to predict the magnitude of the
displacements before measuring them. For in measuring small quantities,
where our own power of estimating has to play a great part, the
influence of any preconception is always to be feared; I think, however,
that the result I have obtained is altogether free from this cause of
error.
</p>
<p>
For the most part the observations were made with a velocity of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 22.912ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/12.svg" alt=" " data-tex="7.059\, \text{metres per second}">; in a certain number the velocity
was <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 12.084ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="5.515\, \text{metres}">, and in others <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 9.821ex; height: 1.579ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="3.7\, \text{metres}">.
The magnitudes observed have been all reduced to the maximum velocity
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 12.084ex; height: 1.579ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="7.059\, \text{metres}">, and referred to the breadth of a band as
unity.

By doubling the mean value we have <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.023ex; height: 1.581ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.46">, nearly half the breadth
of a band, which represents the magnitude of the displacement produced
by reversing the direction of the current in each tube.
</p>
<p>
To show the deviations on each side, the differences between the several
observed displacements and the mean value of all have been inserted in
the Table. It will be seen that, in general, they represent a very small
fraction of the breadth of a band; the greatest deviation does not
exceed one-thirteenth of the breadth of a band.
</p>
<p>
These differences are due to a difficulty which could not be overcome;
the displacement remained at its maximum but for a very short period, so
that the observations had to be made very rapidly. Had it been possible
to maintain the velocity of the current of water constant for a greater
length of time, the measurements would have been more precise; but this
did not appear to be possible without considerably altering the
apparatus, and such alterations would have retarded the prosecution of
my research until the season was no longer favourable for experiments
requiring solar light.
</p>
<p>
I proceed to compare the observed displacement with those which would
result from the first and third hypotheses before alluded to. As to the
second hypothesis, it may be at once rejected; for the very existence of
displacements produced by the motion of water is incompatible with the
supposition of an æther perfectly free and independent of the motion of
bodies.
</p>
<p>
In order to calculate the displacement of the bands under the
supposition that the æther is united to the molecules of bodies in such
a manner as to partake of their movements, let

Since each ray traverses the tubes twice, the length <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> is double the
real length of the tubes. Calling the latter <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 16.881ex; height: 1.731ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="L = 1.4875\, \text{metre}">,
the preceding formula becomes

and the numerical calculation being performed, we find
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 22.25ex; height: 1.805ex;" src="images/30.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\Delta = 0.0002418\,\, \text{millim}.
"></span>
Such is the difference of path which, under the present hypothesis,
ought to exist between the two rays.
</p>
<p>
Strictly speaking, this number has reference to a vacuum, and ought to
be divided by the index of refraction for air; but this index differs so
little from unity, that, for the sake of simplicity, the correction,
which would not alter the last figure by a unit, may be neglected.
</p>
<p>
The above quantity being divided by the length of an undulation, will
give the displacement of the bands in terms of the breadth of one of
them. In fact, for a difference of path amounting to <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 10.045ex; height: 1.946ex;" src="images/31.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1, 2,\, \ldots \,m">
undulations, the system of bands suffer a displacement equal to the
breadth of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 10.045ex; height: 1.946ex;" src="images/31.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1, 2,\, \ldots \,m"> bands.
</p>
<p>
For the ray <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.729ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="E"> the length of an undulation is <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 12.884ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/32.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda = 0.000526">,
and the rays about it appear to preserve the greatest intensity after the
light has traversed a rather considerable thickness of water. Selecting
this ray, then, we find for the displacement the value
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.579ex; width: 12.811ex; height: 4.729ex;" src="images/33.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{\Delta }{\lambda}=0.4597.
"></span>
</p>
<p>
Had, therefore, the æther participated fully in the motion of the
water, in accordance with the hypothesis under consideration, a
displacement of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.023ex; height: 1.581ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.46"> of a band would have been observed in the
foregoing experiments. But the mean of our observations gave only
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.023ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.23">; and on examining the greatest particular values, it will be
found that none approached the number <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.023ex; height: 1.581ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.46">. I may even remark that
the latter number ought to be still greater, in consequence of a small
error committed in the determination of the velocity of the water; an
error whose tendency is known, although, as will soon be seen, it was
impossible to correct it perfectly.
</p>
<p>
I conclude, then, that this hypothesis does not agree with experiment.
We shall next see that, on the contrary, the third, or Fresnel's
hypothesis, leads to a value of the displacement which differs very
little from the result of observation.
</p>
<p>
We know that the ordinary phænomena of refraction are due to the fact
that light is propagated with less velocity in the interior of a body
than in a vacuum. Fresnel supposes that this change of velocity occurs
because the density of the æther within a body is greater than that in
a vacuum. Now for two media whose elasticity is the same, and which
differ only in their densities, the squares of the velocities of
propagation are inversely proportional to these densities; that is,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 10.663ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac {D'}{D}=\frac{v^{2}}{v'^{2}},
"></span>
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.873ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/36.svg" alt=" " data-tex="D"> and <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.873ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/36.svg" alt=" " data-tex="D">' being the densities of the æther in a vacuum and in the
body, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">′ the corresponding velocities. From the above we
easily deduce the relations
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 35.211ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/37.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
D'=D{\frac {v^{2}}{v'^{2}}},\quad D'-D=D{\frac{v^{2}-v'^{2}}{v'^{2}}},
"></span>
the latter of which gives the excess of density of the interior æther.
</p>
<p>
It is assumed that when the body is put in motion, only a part of the
interior æther is carried along with it, and that this part is that
which causes the excess in the density of the interior over that of the
surrounding æther; so that the density of this moveable part is <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 7.14ex; height: 1.903ex;" src="images/38.svg" alt=" " data-tex="D' - D">.
The other part which remains at rest during; the body's motion has the
density <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.873ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/36.svg" alt=" " data-tex="D">.
</p>
<p>
The question now arises, with what velocity will the waves be propagated
in a medium thus constituted of an immoveable and a moveable part, when
for the sake of simplicity we suppose the body to be moving in the
direction of the propagation of the waves?
</p>
<p>
Fresnel considers that the velocity with which the waves are propagated
then becomes increased by the velocity of the centre of gravity of the
stationary and moving portions of æther. Now <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u"> being the velocity
of the body,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 9.43ex; height: 4.799ex;" src="images/39.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{D'-D}{D'}u
"></span>
will be the velocity of the centre of gravity of the system in question,
and according to the last formula this expression is equal to
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 10.294ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/40.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{v^{2}-v'^{2}}{v^{2}}u.
"></span>
Such, then, is the quantity by which the velocity of light will be
augmented; and since <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v">′ is the velocity when the
body is at rest,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 36.484ex; height: 5.07ex;" src="images/41.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
v' + \frac{v^{2}-v'^{2}}{v^{2}}u \quad
\text{and}\quad
v' - \frac{v^{2}-v'^{2}}{v^{2}}u
"></span>
will be the respective velocities when the body moves with and against
the light.
</p>
<p>
By means of these expressions the corresponding displacement of the
bands in our experiment may be calculated in exactly the same manner as
before. For the difference of path we have the value
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.897ex; width: 38.609ex; height: 6.855ex;" src="images/42.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\Delta =E\left\{{\frac
{v}{v'-{\frac {v^{2}-v'^{2}}{v^{2}}}u}}-{\frac {v}{v'+{\frac
{v^{2}-v'^{2}}{v^{2}}}u}}\right\},
"></span>
which by reduction and transformation becomes
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -4.428ex; width: 32.836ex; height: 9.986ex;" src="images/43.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

"></span>
</p>
<p>
Taking into consideration the smallness of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u"> with respect to
<img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 21.215ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/44.svg" alt=" " data-tex="v'\left({\dfrac {u}{v'}}={\dfrac {1}{33000000}}\right)">, and the
circumstance that the coefficient of <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.912ex;" src="images/45.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u^{2}"> differs little from
unity, the term in <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.282ex; height: 1.912ex;" src="images/45.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u^{2}"> may, without appreciable error, be
neglected, and the above expression considerably simplified. In fact, if
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/46.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m"> be the index of refraction, and <img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 8.413ex; height: 4.588ex;" src="images/47.svg" alt=" " data-tex="L = {\dfrac {1}{2}}E"> the
length of each tube, we have approximately
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 19.813ex; height: 4.106ex;" src="images/48.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\Delta = 4L{\frac{u}{v}}\left(m^{2}-1\right),
"></span>
whence by numerical calculation we deduce
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 23.004ex; height: 1.805ex;" src="images/49.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\Delta = 0.00010634\, \text{millim}.
"></span>
On dividing this difference of path by the length <img style="vertical-align: -0.027ex; width: 1.319ex; height: 1.597ex;" src="images/50.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda"> of an
undulation, the magnitude of the displacement becomes
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.579ex; width: 12.811ex; height: 4.729ex;" src="images/51.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

the observed value being <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.023ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/34.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.23">.
</p>
<p>
These values are almost identical; and what is more, the difference
between observation and calculation may be accounted for with great
probability by the presence of the before-mentioned error in estimating
the velocity of the water. I proceed to show that the tendency of this
error may be assigned, and that analogy permits us to assume that its
effect must be very small.
</p>
<p>
The velocity of the water in each tube was calculated by dividing the
volume of water which issued per second from one of the flasks by the
sectional area of the tube. But by this method it is only the <i>mean</i>
velocity of the water which is determined; in other words, that which
would exist provided the several threads of liquid at the centre and
near the sides of the tube moved with equal rapidity. It is evident,
however, that this cannot be the case; for the resistance opposed by the
sides of the tube, acting in a more immediate manner on the neighbouring
threads of liquid, tends to diminish their velocity more than it does
that of the threads nearer the centre of the tube. The velocity of the
water in the centre of the tubes, therefore, must be greater than that
of the water near the sides, and consequently also greater than the mean
of both velocities.
</p>
<p>
Now the slits placed before each tube to admit the rays whose
interference was observed, were situated in the middle of the circular
ends of the tubes; so that the rays necessarily traversed the central
zones, where the velocity of the water exceeded the mean velocity<a id="FNanchor_2_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.
</p>
<p>
The law followed by these variations of velocity in the motion of water
through tubes not having been determined, it was not possible to
introduce the necessary corrections. Nevertheless analogy indicates that
the error resulting therefrom cannot be considerable. In fact, this law
has been determined in the case of water moving through open canals,
where the same cause produces a similar effect; the velocity in the
middle of the canal and near the surface of the water is there also
greater than the mean velocity. It has been found that, for values of
the mean velocity included between
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 24.045ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/52.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1\, \text{and} 5\, \text{metres per second}">, the maximum
velocity is obtained by multiplying this mean velocity by a
certain coefficient which varies from <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 10.812ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/53.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.23\, \text{to}\,
1.11">. Analogy therefore permits us to assume that in our case the
correction to be introduced would be of the same order of magnitude.
</p>
<p>
Now on multiplying <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.294ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="u"> by <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 16.598ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/54.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.1,\, 1.15,\, \text{and}\, 1.2">, and
calculating the corresponding values of the displacement of the bands,
we find in place of <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.023ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/55.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.20"> the values <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 14.836ex; height: 1.971ex;" src="images/56.svg" alt=" " data-tex="0.22,\, 0.23,\, 0.24">
respectively; whence it will be seen that in all probability the
correction would tend to cause still greater agreement between the
observed and the calculated results. We may presume, then, that the
small difference which exists between the two values depends upon a
small error in estimating the real velocity of the water; which error
cannot be rectified in a satisfactory manner, in consequence of the
absence of sufficiently accurate data.
</p>
<p>
Thus the displacement of the bands caused by the motion of water, as
well as the magnitude of this displacement, may be explained in a
satisfactory manner by means of the theory of Fresnel.
</p>
<p>
It was before observed that the motion of air causes no perceptible
displacement of the bands produced by the interference of two rays which
have traversed the moving air in opposite directions. This fact was
established by means of an apparatus which I will briefly describe.
</p>
<p>
A pair of bellows, loaded with weights and worked by a lever, impelled
air forcibly through two parallel copper tubes whose extremities were
closed by glass plates. The diameter of each tube was <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 11.946ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/57.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1\,
\text{centimetre}">, and its effective length <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 11.192ex; height: 1.581ex;" src="images/58.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.495\, \text{metre}">;
the direction of the motion in one tube was opposite to that in the
other, and the pressure under which this motion took place was measured
by a manometer placed at the entrance of the tubes it could be raised to
<img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 12.837ex; height: 1.563ex;" src="images/59.svg" alt=" " data-tex="3\, \text{centimetres}"> of mercury.
</p>
<p>
The velocity of the air was deduced from the pressure and from the
dimensions of the tubes, according to the known laws of the efflux of
gases. The value thus found was checked by means of the known volume of
the bellows, and the number of strokes necessary to produce a
practically constant pressure at the entrance of the tubes. A velocity
of <img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 20.02ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="25\, \text{metres per second}"> could easily be imparted to the air;
occasionally greater velocities were reached, but their values remained
uncertain.
</p>
<p>
In no experiment could a perceptible displacement of the bands be
produced: they always occupied the same positions, no matter whether the
air remained at rest, or moved with a velocity equal or even superior to
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 20.02ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/60.svg" alt=" " data-tex="25\, \text{metres per second}">.
</p>
<p>
When this experiment was made, the possibility of doubling, by means of
a reflecting telescope, the value of the displacement, and at the same
time of completely compensating any effects due to accidental
differences of temperature or pressure in the two tubes, had not
suggested itself; but I employed a sure method of distinguishing between
the effects due to motion, and those resulting from accidental
circumstances.
</p>
<p>
This method consisted in making two successive observations, by causing
the rays to traverse the apparatus in opposite directions. For this
purpose the source of light was placed at the point where the central
band had previously been, when the new bands formed themselves where the
source of light had previously been placed.
</p>
<p>
The direction of the motion of the air in the tubes remaining the same
in both cases, it is easy to see that the accidental effects would in
both observations give rise to a displacement towards the same tube,
whilst the displacement due solely to motion would first be on the side
of one tube and then on the side of the other. In this manner a
displacement due to motion would have been detected with certainty, even
if it had been accompanied by an accidental displacement due, for
instance, to some defect of symmetry in the diameters or orifices of the
tubes, whence would result an unequal resistance to the passage of air,
and consequently a difference of density.
</p>
<p>
But the symmetry given to the apparatus was so perfect that no sensible
difference of density existed in the two tubes during the motion of the
air. The double observation was consequently unnecessary; nevertheless
it was made for the sake of greater security, and in order to be sure
that the sought displacement was not accidentally compensated by a
difference of density, which, though small, might be sufficient totally
to mask such displacement.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding these precautions, however, no displacement of the bands
occurred in consequence of the motion of the air; and according to an
estimate I have made, a displacement equal to one-tenth of the breadth
of a band would have been detected had it occurred.
</p>
<p>
The calculations with respect to this experiment are as follows. Under
the hypothesis that the air, when moving, carries with it all the
æther, we have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 32.701ex; height: 4.106ex;" src="images/61.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\Delta = 2L{\frac{u}{v}}m^{2} = 0.002413\,\, \text{millim.},
"></span>
<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 2.974ex; height: 1.912ex;" src="images/62.svg" alt=" " data-tex="m^{2}"> being equal to <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 8.548ex; height: 1.579ex;" src="images/63.svg" alt=" " data-tex="1.000567"> at the temperature <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.86ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/64.svg" alt=" " data-tex="10^{o} \text{C}">.
</p>
<p>
This experiment having been made in air, the maximum illumination was
due to the yellow rays; and this maximum determined the breadth of the
bands. Hence the value of <img style="vertical-align: -0.027ex; width: 1.319ex; height: 1.597ex;" src="images/50.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\lambda"> corresponding to the ray <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.873ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/36.svg" alt=" " data-tex="D"> being
taken, we have
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.579ex; width: 12.811ex; height: 4.729ex;" src="images/65.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\frac{\Delta}{\lambda} = 0.4103.
"></span>
</p>
<p>
Now so great a displacement could certainly not have escaped
observation, especially since it might have been doubled by reversing
the current.
</p>
<p>
The following would be the results of the calculation according to the
hypothesis of Fresnel:&mdash;
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 35.525ex; height: 4.106ex;" src="images/66.svg" alt=" " data-tex="

Now a displacement equal to <img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 7.658ex; height: 4.638ex;" src="images/68.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{5000}\text{th}">
of the breadth of a band could not be observed; it might, in fact, be a
hundred times greater and still escape observation. Thus the apparent
immobility of the bands in the experiment made with moving air may be
explained by the theory of Fresnel, according to which the displacement
in question, although not absolutely zero, is so small as to escape
observation.
</p>
<p>
After having established this negative fact, and seeking, by means of
the several hypotheses respecting æther, to explain it as well as the
phenomenon of aberration and the experiment of Arago, it appeared to me
to be necessary to admit, with Fresnel, that the motion of bodies
changes the velocity with which light traverses them, but that this
change of velocity varies according to the energy with which the
traversed medium refracts light; so that the change is great for highly
refracting bodies, but small for feebly refracting ones such as air.
</p>
<p>
I was thus led to anticipate a sensible displacement of the bands by
means of the motion of water, since its index of refraction greatly
exceeds that of air.
</p>
<p>
It is true that an experiment of Babinet's, mentioned in the ninth
volume of the <i>Comptes Rendus</i>, appeared to be in contradiction to the
hypothesis of a change in the velocity of light in accordance with the
law of Fresnel. But on considering the conditions of that experiment, I
detected the existence of a cause of compensation whose influence would
render the effect due to motion insensible. This cause proceeds from the
reflexion which the light suffers in the experiment in question. It may,
in fact, be demonstrated that if a certain difference of path exists
between two rays, that difference becomes altered when these rays suffer
reflexion from a moving mirror. Now on calculating separately the two
effects (of reflexion) in the experiment of Babinet, their magnitudes
will be found to be equal and opposite in sign.
</p>
<p>
This explanation rendered the hypothesis of a change of velocity still
more probable, and induced me to undertake the experiment with water, as
being the most suitable one for deciding the question with certainty.
</p>
<p>
The success of this experiment must, I think, lead to the adoption of
the hypothesis of Fresnel, or at least to that of the law discovered by
him, which expresses the relation between the change of velocity and the
motion of the body; for although the fact of this law being found to be
true constitutes a strong argument in favour of the hypothesis of which
it is a mere consequence, yet to many the conception of Fresnel will
doubtless still appear both extraordinary and, in some respects,
improbable; and before it can be accepted as the expression of the real
state of things, additional proofs will be demanded from the physicist,
as well as a thorough examination of the subject from the mathematician.

<hr class="r5">

<p>
Shortly before the publication of the above interesting memoir in the
<i>Annales de Chimie</i>, M. Fizeau presented to the Academy a second
memoir, containing the results of his experiments on the effect of the
motion of a transparent solid body, such as glass, upon the velocity
with which it is traversed by light. The <i>Comptes Rendus</i> of
November 14th, 1859, contains a brief extract from this memoir; and from
it we gather the principal results of his experiments, and the
principles upon which the same were based.
</p>
<p>
The method of experiment which was employed in the foregoing researches
on air and water being no longer applicable, recourse was had to the
following property of light established by the researches of Malus,
Biot, and Brewster. When a ray of polarized light traverses a plate of
glass, inclined towards its direction, the plane of polarization of the
transmitted ray is in general inclined towards that of the incident ray.
The magnitude of the rotation of the plane of polarization which is thus
caused by the two refractions at the two surfaces of the plate of glass
depends, <i>first</i>, upon the angle of incidence; <i>secondly</i>, upon
the azimuth of the primitive plane of polarization with reference to the
plane of incidence; and <i>thirdly</i>, upon the index of refraction of the
glass forming the plate.
</p>
<p>
The angle of incidence and the azimuth of the primitive plane of
polarization remaining the same, the rotation of this plane increases
with the index of refraction of the glass plate. Now since this index is
inversely proportional to the velocity with which waves of light are
propagated through the glass, it follows that the magnitude of the
rotation of the plane of polarization increases when the velocity with
which light traverses the glass plate diminishes. The determination of
any change in this velocity is, therefore, reduced to that of the
corresponding change in the rotation of the plane of polarization.
</p>
<p>
In the first place it was deemed necessary to determine the change in
the rotation which any given increase or decrease of the index of
refraction could produce. By direct and comparative measurements of
these indices and rotations, in the cases of flint and ordinary glass,
it was found that when the index was increased by a small fraction, the
rotation increased by a fraction <img style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 3.258ex; height: 4.588ex;" src="images/70.svg" alt=" " data-tex="4\dfrac{1}{2}"> times greater than the
first.
</p>
<p>
The question next arises what change, according to the hypothesis of
Fresnel, ought to be produced in the velocity of light when it traverses
glass in a state of motion? The answer is based upon the following data.
</p>
<p>
The greatest velocity at our command is unquestionably that of the earth
in its orbit. At noon, during the period of the solstices, for instance,
the direction of this motion is horizontal and from east to west; from
this it follows that when a plate of glass receives a ray of light
coming from the west, it ought to be considered as really moving
to meet the ray with the immense velocity of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 24.798ex; height: 2.009ex;" src="images/71.svg" alt=" " data-tex="31,000\,\, \text{metres per second}">. When, on the contrary,
the incident ray comes from the cast, the glass plate must be
considered as moving with this velocity in the same direction as
that of the propagation of the waves of light, by which latter
it is in reality overtaken.
</p>
<p>
Now, according to the theory of Fresnel, the difference between the
velocities of the light in these two extreme cases would be sufficient
to produce a change in the rotation of the plane of polarization equal
to <img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 7.658ex; height: 4.638ex;" src="images/68.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\dfrac{1}{5000}\text{th}"> part of the magnitude of
that rotation.
</p>
<p>
In order to test this result by experiment, a series of glass plates
were interposed in the path of a polarized beam of parallel rays of
light. The primitive plane of polarization was determined by a divided
circle, and the rotation which this plane underwent by the action of the
plates was measured by means of a second graduated circle fixed to a
convenient analyser. The instrument could, moreover, be fixed in any
direction so as to study the influence of all terrestrial motions upon
the phænomena.
</p>
<p>
In order to make the two necessary observations conveniently and
rapidly, two mirrors were previously fixed on the east and on the west
of the instrument, and upon each, alternately, a beam of solar light was
thrown by means of a heliostat, and thence reflected towards the
instrument.
</p>
<p>
The greatest difficulties were encountered in the annealing of the glass
plates of the series; and as perfectly homogeneous plates could not be
obtained, it was necessary to employ various compensating expedients,
all which will be found described in the memoir itself.
</p>
<p>
The conclusions to which M. Fizeau was led by means of more than <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.525ex; height: 1.557ex;" src="images/72.svg" alt=" " data-tex="2000">
observations are thus stated:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. The rotation of the plane of polarization produced by a series of
inclined glass plates is always greater when the light which traverses
them comes from the west than when it comes from the east; the
observation being made about noon.
</p>
<p>
2. This excess of rotation is decidedly at a maximum at or about noon
during the solstices. Before and after this hour it is less, and at
about 4 o'clock is scarcely perceptible.
</p>
<p>
3. The numerical values deduced from the numerous series of observations
present notable differences, the cause of which may be guessed, though
it cannot yet be determined with certitude.
</p>
<p>
4. The influence of the earth's annual motion, as determined by
calculation on the hypothesis of Fresnel, leads to values of the above
excess of rotation which agree tolerably well with the majority of the
values deduced from observation.
</p>
<p>
5. Theory, as well as experiment, therefore, lead us to conclude that
the azimuth of the plane of polarization of a refracted ray is really
influenced by the motion of the refracting medium, and that the motion
of the earth in space exerts an influence of this kind upon the rotation
of the plane of polarization produced by a series of inclined glass
plates.

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
